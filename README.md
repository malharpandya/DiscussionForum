Note for the T.A/Prof:
  I had been following the steps for gitflow from the professor's 
  recommended [website](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
  
  About halfway through my assignment I reaalized that the websit doesn't tell m to push my feature branches to github,
  so even though I did my work by branching into features, all of it was local.
  So I made this private piazza [post](https://piazza.com/class/keswqh47g2bm?cid=313).
  
  NOTE: After the post, I made sure I pushed my feature branches, as seen by my updated call for "git log --graph --decorate --oneline"
  
  Here are the requested items to show I followed gitflow:
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/a2-han-solo/blob/master/git%20branch.png "local git branches")
  ![alt text](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/a2-han-solo/blob/master/git%20log%20--graph%20--decorate%20--oneline.png "local git graph")
  
  I hope you recognize this as a tiny error, and that I still followed the gitflow "locally".
  
  Thank you,
